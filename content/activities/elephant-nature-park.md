# An Unforgettable Day with Elephants

Elephant Nature Park is not your typical elephant experience. Founded by the legendary Lek Chailert, this sanctuary rescues elephants from the tourism and logging industries, giving them a chance to live out their days in peace.

## What to Expect

- **Morning pickup** from the hostel around 8:00 AM
- Feed elephants their breakfast (bananas, watermelons, pumpkins!)
- Walk alongside these gentle giants through the sanctuary grounds
- Enjoy a delicious vegetarian lunch with views of elephants bathing
- Optional: Help bathe elephants in the river in the afternoon

## Why We Love It

Unlike riding camps, here you interact with elephants on their terms. They're free to roam, socialize, and live naturally. You'll learn about each elephant's rescue story - some are heartbreaking, but all have happy endings.

## Good to Know

- **Duration**: Full day (8 AM - 5 PM)
- **Price range**: Around 2,500 THB including transport and lunch
- **Book ahead**: At least 2-3 days in advance (very popular!)
- **What to bring**: Comfortable clothes you don't mind getting muddy, sunscreen, camera
- **Best time**: Any time of year, but mornings are cooler

Ask us at reception and we'll help you book the perfect day!
