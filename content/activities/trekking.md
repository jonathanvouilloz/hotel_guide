# Explore the Mountains

Chiang Mai is surrounded by stunning mountain ranges, lush jungles, and traditional hill tribe villages. A trekking trip takes you far from the tourist trail into the real heart of Northern Thailand.

## Types of Treks

### Day Treks (6-8 hours)
Perfect if you're short on time. You'll hike through jungle trails, visit a waterfall, and possibly stop at a Karen or Hmong village. Back at the hostel by evening.

### 2-Day / 1-Night Treks
The classic experience. Hike to a remote village, sleep in a traditional homestay, wake up to mountain views, and continue exploring the next day. Usually includes bamboo rafting on the way back.

### 3+ Day Adventures
For serious adventurers. Deeper into the wilderness, multiple villages, camping under the stars, and experiences you'll never forget.
