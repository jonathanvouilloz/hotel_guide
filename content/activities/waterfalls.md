# Chase Waterfalls

When the Thai heat gets too much, there's nothing better than a trip to one of the stunning waterfalls around Chiang Mai. Pack your swimsuit and get ready to cool off!

## Popular Waterfalls

### Bua Tong (Sticky Waterfalls)
The most unique waterfall experience! The limestone rocks are covered in a mineral that makes them grippy - you can actually climb UP the waterfall. Super fun and totally safe.

### Mae Sa Waterfall
A series of 10 cascading tiers in Doi Suthep-Pui National Park. Each level has pools for swimming. About 30 minutes from the city.

### Huay Kaew Waterfall
The closest to the city, just behind Chiang Mai University. Small but pretty, perfect for a quick escape. Best during rainy season.

### Mon Tha Than Waterfall
Hidden gem in Doi Suthep. Less crowded, beautiful jungle setting, great for a peaceful swim.

## Tips for Waterfall Visits

- **Best season**: July to November (rainy season = more water)
- **Bring**: Swimsuit, towel, water shoes (rocks can be slippery), dry bag for phone
- **Entrance fees**: Usually 100-200 THB for national parks
- **Food**: Most waterfalls have small restaurants nearby

## Getting There

- **Scooter**: The most flexible option, 30-60 minutes depending on location
