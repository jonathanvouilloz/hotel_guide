# Sacred Spaces of Chiang Mai

Chiang Mai was once the capital of the Lanna Kingdom, and its spiritual heritage lives on in over 300 Buddhist temples. From golden spires to hidden forest monasteries, temple-hopping is essential.

## Must-Visit Temples

### Wat Phra That Doi Suthep
The iconic temple on the mountain overlooking the city. Climb the 309-step naga staircase (or take the cable car) for stunning views and one of Thailand's most sacred sites.

### Wat Chedi Luang
A massive 14th-century temple in the heart of the old city. The original structure was damaged by an earthquake, giving it a hauntingly beautiful ruined appearance.

### Wat Phra Singh
Home to the city's most revered Buddha image. Beautiful Lanna architecture and peaceful gardens.

### Wat Umong
A forest temple with ancient tunnels and a serene atmosphere. Feed the fish, explore the meditation paths, and escape the city buzz.

## Temple Etiquette

- **Dress code**: Cover shoulders and knees (sarongs available at most temples)
- **Shoes off**: Remove footwear before entering buildings
- **Respect**: Don't point your feet at Buddha images
- **Photos**: Usually allowed, but ask first in sacred areas

## Best Ways to Explore

- **By bicycle**: Rent a bike and explore the old city temples at your own pace
- **Songthaew tour**: Share a red truck with other travelers for Doi Suthep
- **Monk chat**: Some temples offer programs where you can chat with monks about Buddhism
- **Sunrise/sunset**: Visit Doi Suthep at golden hour for magical photos

Most temples are free or have a small donation (20-50 THB). Doi Suthep entrance is 30 THB.
