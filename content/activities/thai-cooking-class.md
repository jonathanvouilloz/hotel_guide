# Cook Like a Local

Ever wondered how to make that perfect pad thai or green curry? A Thai cooking class is one of the best souvenirs you can take home - skills that last a lifetime!

## The Experience

Most classes start with a visit to a local market where you'll:
- Learn to identify Thai herbs and ingredients
- Pick your own fresh vegetables, meats, and spices
- Discover the secrets of Thai flavor combinations

Then it's off to the kitchen where you'll cook **4-5 dishes** from scratch, typically including:
- A curry (green, red, or massaman)
- Pad Thai or another stir-fry
- Tom Yum or Tom Kha soup
- Mango sticky rice for dessert

## Different Options

**Morning classes** (9 AM - 1 PM): Include market tour, best for food lovers who want the full experience

**Afternoon classes** (2 PM - 6 PM): Skip the market, more hands-on cooking time

**Farm-to-table**: Some schools have their own organic farms - you'll pick ingredients straight from the garden!

## Good to Know

- **Price range**: 800-1,500 THB depending on the school
